Purpose/Description: 
This program searches a matrix of size n for all occurrences of a specific 
number. The input matrix must have individual row and column be strong 
decreasing sequences. The algorithm starts at the bottom left element of 
the matrix and moves along testing each number. 

Then it searches the matrix diagonally, which means that in the worst case
the algorithm would have to search the entire matrix thus giving it a 
complexity of O(n).
